# 🧹 **Data Cleaning Lab for Movie Dataset**

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on cleaning a messy movie dataset, which contains various issues such as missing values, incorrect formatting, and inconsistent data types. The aim is to preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis, using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning and numerical operations.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- 🔍 Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
- 🛠️ Correct inconsistent or incorrect data formats.
- 📊 Prepare the data for future analysis by ensuring all entries are properly formatted and cleaned.

---

## 🚀 **Tasks**
1. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Replace missing values in relevant columns with appropriate defaults or interpolations.
   
2. **Fix Formatting Issues**:
   - Standardize inconsistent data types (e.g., converting numerical values stored as strings back to numerical format).
   - Correct invalid entries in the dataset, such as incorrect titles or character encoding issues.

3. **Prepare the Data for Analysis**:
   - Ensure the cleaned dataset is ready for further processing, including statistical analysis or machine learning applications.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**
- 🧽 **Data Cleaning**: Performed extensive cleaning on movie-related data, including fixing NaN values, correcting string formats, and ensuring numerical consistency.
- 📋 **Data Formatting**: Adjusted incorrect data types and standardized all entries for uniformity.

## 📂 **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MelikBLK/Data-Cleaning-Lab-for-Movie-Dataset.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash

## 🚨 **Important**:
Since this project was developed in a Kaggle environment, you will need to change the file path for the CSV file in the notebook to match the location on your local system. Make sure to update the path as follows:

```python
# Update the file path
file_path = pd.read_csv("path_to_your_local_csv_file.csv")
```

## 📊 **Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes several attributes about movies such as title, Facebook likes, duration, gross income, and IMDB score. Data cleaning was essential to ensure these attributes are accurate and usable for further analysis.
